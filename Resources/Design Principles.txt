These are project standards to keep in mind.

== [ float > double ] ==

Principle: Use floats rather than doubles

Justification:
- more efficient
- lower precision
- lower latency
- default JUCE type

== [ multithreading: async vs lock ] ==

Use locks or mutexes when multiple threads need to read and write shared mutable data

Use async callbacks when one thread just needs to hand off data to another
